1. Algorithm to find the optimized route between two point.
2. Route will avoid the obstacle on its way.
3. Use evolutionary method to generate optimized route.
4. Use combination of A* and Dijkstra  algorithm for further optimization.[Remaining]
5. Use algorithm on the real world map.[Remaining]

Initial route generation.
